# Hackfest-Event-Sentiment-Analysis
web scrapping from reddit -> model is predicting and storing it in the sql


the file store_reviews is onlt for the testing purpose of the model it manually takes reviews from the users and predicts the outcome and adds it to the sql

sentiment_model_enhanced is a backup model ..it is not that accurate compared to the bert model
